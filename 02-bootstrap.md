# Bootstrap Implementation History

## Initial Request: Update UI to use Bootstrap

### Changes Made
1. Added Bootstrap CSS and JS links to both HTML files:
   ```html
   <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
   <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
   <!-- Bootstrap JS Bundle with Popper -->
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
   ```

2. Replaced custom container and layout styles with Bootstrap's container and utility classes:
   - Used `container` class for the main wrapper
   - Added spacing utilities like `mb-4` (margin-bottom)
   - Used `d-flex` and `justify-content-center` for centering elements

3. Replaced custom UI components with Bootstrap equivalents:
   - Navigation buttons → Bootstrap's `btn-group` and `btn` classes
   - Custom panels → Bootstrap `card` components with `card-header` and `card-body`
   - Custom form elements → Bootstrap's `form-range`, `form-label`, etc.
   - Custom buttons → Bootstrap's button styles (`btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, etc.)

4. Updated typography and spacing using Bootstrap's utility classes

## Follow-up Request: Fix President Legend Display

### Issue
The list of presidents legend had the color box indicating the color as a box on a line before the name, but it needed to be on the same line with the names/terms aligned next to the boxes.

### Solution
Added flexbox styling to properly align the president legend items:

```css
.president-item {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
}
.president-color {
    width: 20px;
    height: 20px;
    margin-right: 10px;
    border-radius: 3px;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

The key changes were:
1. Using `display: flex` on the container to make items appear in a row
2. Adding `align-items: center` to vertically center the elements
3. Adding `flex-shrink: 0` to the color box to prevent it from shrinking
4. Setting appropriate margins to create spacing between elements

These changes ensured that the color box, president name, and term information all appeared on the same line with proper alignment.
